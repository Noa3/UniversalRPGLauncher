# UniversalRPG Autonomous Session State

> Updated: 2026-08-20
> Purpose: small durable checkpoint for Hermes/other autonomous agents.

## Current card

`K-011` — Implement the bounded LMT map-tree parser and verify it against the pinned RM2000/2003 fixtures.

## Last verified baseline

The previous handoff reported 77/77 GDScript tests and smoke tests passing before this stabilization pass. The current suite contains 102 `test_*` methods after database, decoder, parser, and real-fixture coverage. Godot 4.7.2 validation now passes locally on Windows: 102/102 core tests and smoke tests are green.

## Validated stabilization changes

- `VirtualClock` repeating callback cadence fixed; stable event IDs introduced; slow-motion speed factor corrected; monotonic FPS sampling added.
- Compatibility game-specific flags now truly override global defaults.
- `RM2KDatabase` compile/serialization defects repaired and round-trip tests added.
- New VirtualClock regression suite and RM2KDatabase regression suite.
- `GameDetector` now refuses symlink/junction directory matches for Data/www/js/Scripts discovery.
- `scripts/validate.sh` and GitHub validation workflow added.
- Kanban/agent recovery protocol added.
- `RM2KDatabase` array comprehensions were replaced with valid GDScript serialization loops; all database collections now have focused serialization coverage.
- `VirtualClock` uses GDScript `float`/`maxi()` types compatible with Godot 4.7.2 warning-as-error parsing.
- `scripts/validate.sh` discovers the local Windows Godot 4.7.2 editor without `GODOT_BIN`.

## Completed K-002

- Normalized CP932/SJIS aliases to Godot's supported `SHIFT_JIS` decoder name; added `test_legacy_text_decoder.gd`.
- Replaced the VFS `"\\u0000"` source literal with byte-level NUL detection and retained security regression coverage.
- Updated current test counts and validation status in project documentation.

## Completed K-010

- Added provenance-pinned EasyRPG/TestGame RM2000 and RM2003 LDB/LMT/LMU fixtures with SHA-256 notes.
- Added real-fixture parser/framing tests for both databases and maps.
- Accepted valid zero-length struct-array sections and retained unknown top-level chunks.

## Current action

Inspect the pinned `RPG_RT.lmt` bytes and existing LCF reader limits. Determine the actual map-tree entry structure from the two fixtures, then implement a bounded data-only parser with tests for valid, empty, truncated, oversized, and invalid-parent/cycle inputs.

## Next action

Completed for K-001/K-002/K-010:

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

Result: passed with Godot 4.7.2 stable; 102/102 core tests and smoke tests passed. Continue with K-011.

## Failure log

- 2026-08-20 | K-001 | Signature: `./scripts/validate.sh` -> exit 127, `Godot 4.7.2 was not found`. Hypothesis: the wrapper only knows POSIX/editor-PATH locations while this Windows checkout has a local Godot binary. Evidence: `E:/URPG/Godot_v4.7.2/Godot_v4.7.2-stable_mono_win64_console.exe` exists and reports `4.7.2.stable.mono.official.ed1daf0bf`. Changed prerequisite: supplied `GODOT_BIN`; result: validation reached import/tests and exposed source failures. Next attempt will repair the source signatures, not retry discovery unchanged.
- 2026-08-20 | K-001 | Signature: Godot test runner -> `Parse Error: Expected closing "]" after array elements` at `src/rm2k/database/rm2k_database.gd:341`, preventing `RM2KDatabase` and `tests/core/test_rm2k_database.gd` from loading. Hypothesis: Python-style array comprehensions are not valid GDScript 4.7.2. Evidence: direct Godot load reports the exact parser location. Attempt 1: source inspection/direct load; confirmed. Next attempt will replace only the invalid serialization syntax and add focused coverage.
- 2026-08-20 | K-001 | Signature: Godot test runner -> `Could not find type "double"` at `src/core/virtual_clock.gd:54,232`, followed by Variant-inference warnings treated as errors at lines 150 and 158. Hypothesis: the stabilization patch used a non-GDScript type and generic `max()` where typed `float`/`maxi()` are required. Evidence: direct Godot load reproduces all locations. Attempt 1: source inspection/direct load; confirmed. Repair: changed the time values to `float`, made `now`/`elapsed` explicit floats, and replaced `max()` with `maxi()`. Result: targeted core suite and full validation passed.
- 2026-08-20 | K-001 | Signature: direct `godot --headless --path . --script res://src/rm2k/database/rm2k_database.gd` timed out after 120s with no further output. Cause: a pure `RefCounted` class script does not own a `SceneTree` exit path when invoked as the main script. Action: terminated by timeout and did not repeat unchanged; validation uses `tests/runner.gd`, which exits normally. Result: no source failure indicated; core suite passed.
- 2026-08-20 | K-002 | Signature: successful smoke run emitted `ERROR: Conversion failed: Unknown encoding` from `legacy_text_decoder.gd:25` on Windows for CP932 metadata. Repair: normalized CP932/SJIS aliases to the supported `SHIFT_JIS` name and added three decoder tests. Result: `95/95` core tests and the full validation pass without the diagnostic.
- 2026-08-20 | K-002 | Signature: successful VFS suite emitted six `Unexpected NUL character` parser diagnostics from the `"\\u0000"` literal in the VFS security check and its test. Repair: changed production code to byte-level NUL detection and tested the helper with `PackedByteArray` values, avoiding an engine warning while preserving the security assertion. Result: full validation pass has no NUL diagnostics.
- 2026-08-20 | K-010 | Signature: real RM2003 LDB parse rejected `class_duplicate` at offset `0x60D85` with EOF on an empty payload. Hypothesis: the valid fixture uses zero-length encoding for an empty struct array instead of BER count zero. Evidence: independent raw framing showed chunk `0x1f` length `0` and the next chunk begins exactly at `0x60D85`. Repair: accept empty struct-array payloads as count zero; keep non-empty BER/truncation checks unchanged. Result: both real LDBs/LMUs and `102/102` core tests pass.

## Recovery rule

If validation fails, keep the failure signature here. Use at most three materially different attempts for the same signature; after that mark the corresponding Kanban card blocked and continue with an independent ready card.
